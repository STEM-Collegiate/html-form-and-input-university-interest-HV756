# STEM Collegiate University Visit Registration Form  
### Student Project Checklist

---

## **Overview**
Students will design and code a fully functional **University Visit Registration Form** for STEM Collegiate.  
The form will allow students to sign up for **university presentations and information sessions** held on campus.  
It should demonstrate proper use of **HTML inputs**, **labels**, and **form structure**, following professional web standards.  
All inputs must include **name**, **id**, **value**, and **placeholder** attributes where applicable, and be properly labeled.

Students will use the form to indicate **who they are**, **which universities they want to learn about**, and **when they can attend**.  
The data will help the event organizers assign time slots and prepare materials for attendees.
